## About the Game
Invasion City is a 3*3 grid game that helps us to explore Reinforcement Learning strategies. It tries to examine the machine logic as it learns. It demonstrates how an artificial intelligence can develop and learn to pay. The machine learns fromthe mistakes it makes and becomes unbeatable.

## Purpose
As students, we realize that just studying is not fun unless you associate a feeling
or an emotion with it. It has also been proven by multiple scientists that once you
associate information with specific emotion retention goes up by over 40%. In
order to make use of this information, we tried to create a project that helps you
remember reinforcement learning in a way you never forget. Taking the help of
a story we associate reinforcement learning with the emotions of freedom success
happiness etc. We believe that in this way we can help students retain better and
understand the real meaning rather than just bookish knowledge.

## Introduction to the project 
We decide to make a multifaceted game which is fun introducing users to the
concepts of reinforcement learning and development of artificial Intelligence.
Our game has various features which make it unique .

1. Storyline â€“ We have a interesting storyline depicted through a video which
helps to gain the attention of the user.

2. Graph- Our game shows a graph which depicts the win ratio of AI creating a
sense of winning and success in the heart of the user. At the same time
understanding the essence of reinforcement learning.

3. Automate- If a person just wants to see the graph in order to understand the
concept of reinforcement learning then he can also do so using our automate
function.

4. Two Player- The game also allows you to play with your friends this fun game.


## How to play
1. You play white, the AI plays black
2. There are two types of valid moves:
    * Move one of your pawns 1 square straight ahead if free
    * Move one of your pawns 1 square diagonally ahead if ccupied by the opponent and capture the piece
3. The game is won in one of three ways:
    * Moving a pawn to the opposite end of the board
    * Capturing all enemy pawns
    * Achieving a position in which the enemy can't move
